## About the Survey

Designed based on insights from a Systematic Literature Review, this survey addresses the research gap regarding modern prioritization techniques.

**Key Objectives:**
1. Assess the adoption and value of **traditional** prioritization methods.
2. Assess the adoption and value of **AI/ML-based** prioritization methods.
3. Gauge professional attitudes toward the **future adoption** of AI/ML-based methods.

**Methodology & Demographics:**
* **Recruitment:** Participants were recruited online via LinkedIn (direct outreach and groups), Slack communities (MindTheProduct, Product School, SerbianProductCommunity), Toptal, and Reddit (r/productmgmt).
* **Sample Size:** A total of **307 valid responses** were gathered.
* **Exclusion Criteria:** Respondents who had not actively participated in product backlog prioritization in the past 12 months were disqualified (20 respondents, ~6.5%).
* **Integrity:** Responses were anonymous, unique (limited to 1 per Google account), and organic (no financial incentives were offered).

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

- **`Data/`**: Contains the dataset gathered via Google Forms.
- **`Code/`**: Contains the Python scripts used to process and analyze the data.
